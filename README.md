LED_Matrix
==========

This is a demo app for the LED Matrix I have made using WS2801 pixels.

The hardware side is and arduino receiving the data via bluetooth (although could use serial) and pushing it out to the LEDs using the FastLED library.

The music playback is handled with the Bass.net api.

Cheers.
